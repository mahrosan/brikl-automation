To do for Cypress and Robot

Run the command:

     npm install
To Open and Run cypress:

     npx cypress open OR npm run cy:open
     npx cypress run OR npm run cy:run
To run all of the Robots Intergration test cases. Tried to implement the API test with CSV file as test data but the body part of the API which is taking the query made some issue with it. So just kept the brittle test cases in it.
